# My HackerHank solutions

The main idea of this repo is to keep and share my solutions to some HackerHank challenges I do
to:
    * evaluate later on 
    * share with the community to help people searching for solutions
    * get community feedback on readability and performance on given solutions

The idea is to also have the same solution solved in more than on programming language trying to
take advantage of the given language and possible paradigms.

I will try to write all functions with the same signature from the challenge, and 
write unit tests for all the public cases on the site.

I will also keep a makefile in the root folder to run all the tests, by programming language.

## Current used programming languages:

* Golang
